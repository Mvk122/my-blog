# About This Blog

This blog serves as a personal repository of timeless notes, documenting the principles I learn throughout my career. It aims to bridge the online knowledge gap by providing valuable insights that those who have paved the way before me seldom document. 

The blog addresses the lack of intermediate-level content online, where resources are often either highly technical and niche, appealing only to engineers within a niche, or overly simplified "leetcode" tutorials selling a dream to to prospective engineers.
